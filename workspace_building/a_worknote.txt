searching keyword:
sight area, sight line, view analysis
about matching strategy:
1.
base hypotysis:
the centre of the image hits on the house
strategy:
sent out a centre line of sight and define the first hit house as target
calculate the looking angle of other corner points of the house, define the edge-sight relationship of the image 
2.
base hypotysis:
none
strategy:
use CV to detect the building edges in image
workout the looking angle to each edge
snap the edge to the builidng corner points in building databsae
split image into different section
problem:
image projection unsure
3.(combined) - do this for now
use the first strategy, if distance larger than threshold, ture to two
problem:
threshold setting
