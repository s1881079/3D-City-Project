4.8 - inits============================
gcpURL.py
automatic download google street view using information from gsv_info.csv
gsv_info.csv
slightly corrected from the previous version since the size of image changed
imgs/
save the GSVimages

4.14======================================
dld_iods.py
logic of the code make sense - but need to set up object detection API to step further

4.17=======================================
Setting up environment for running tensorflow
Magnus's suggestion: running it on university's reserch compute cluster - eddie
permission denied - fixing currently

Local installation
prorc - environmental variable setting done
object detection model setup issue
TODO: C++ version update to 9.0

XRDP installation
not supproting SSE4.1, therefore might mot be able to run tensorflow this way

NOTE:
- the computer vision stuff might take longer than you expected,
therefore yu can start to get familiar with the Unity stuff first and write about the tech repos 

4.23================================================
tensorflow-gpu environment not properly setup
list of Q for magnus:
edditing codes in eddie
tensorflow for use 

bring your own laptop and try to run module detection stuff
-the last question should be solved by installing absl pckages

4.24=======================================================
tensorflow-gpu encironment problem fixed
note on fixing:
- need to use qlogin -pe gpu 1 -l h_vmem=16G to login to the backend of ecdf
- qsub used to submit the bash file for running codes
- qstat for viewing the current status

NOTE:
the download procees should have already finished the step of setting tfrecord as well 
check the difference of the two codes and try

4.25=====================================================
open image dataset download succeeded
figures:
of all 499440 images:
4290 contain doors
12 format error
9 url error
4269 images are used
result: Door.tfrecord file in scratch space, move to somewhere if needed

4.29=========================================================
eddie does not support CUDA9, which means it cannot use the object detection API, and i don't think they will update their computing kernel installed

however i finally got the API running on my CPU - slower though, could try to move forward to the training part: need to move the rf records from eddie to local

$ scp Door_train.tfrecord ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk:/home/s1881079

fixing bugs in the former script for downloading door images - number of images 
updating schema for spliting training and testing 
## NUMBER OF TRAINING IMAGE IS SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT

door img:165

trian img:115

format error_train:9

url error_train8

test img:29

format error test:3

url error test1


information specified in https://www.learnopencv.com/fast-image-downloader-for-open-images-v4/
Door images:
train19256
validation165
test524

test and validation set are all human corrected - which would be better to use in trainning model.

5.11 ==================================================
strategy changed:
using vision API to identify door, put matching process after computer vision process
before matching, the input data should contain the information of the door location

5.21===================================================
including test image set
door_img:689
train_img 503
format_error 25
url error 23
test img 126
format error 2
url error 10
