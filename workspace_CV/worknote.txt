4.8 - inits============================
gcpURL.py
automatic download google street view using information from gsv_info.csv
gsv_info.csv
slightly corrected from the previous version since the size of image changed
imgs/
save the GSVimages

4.14======================================
dld_iods.py
logic of the code make sense - but need to set up object detection API to step further

4.17=======================================
Setting up environment for running tensorflow
Magnus's suggestion: running it on university's reserch compute cluster - eddie
permission denied - fixing currently

Local installation
prorc - environmental variable setting done
object detection model setup issue
TODO: C++ version update to 9.0

XRDP installation
not supproting SSE4.1, therefore might mot be able to run tensorflow this way

NOTE:
- the computer vision stuff might take longer than you expected,
therefore yu can start to get familiar with the Unity stuff first and write about the tech repos 

4.23================================================
tensorflow-gpu environment not properly setup
list of Q for magnus:
edditing codes in eddie
tensorflow for use 

bring your own laptop and try to run module detection stuff
-the last question should be solved by installing absl pckages

4.24=======================================================
tensorflow-gpu encironment problem fixed
note on fixing:
- need to use qlogin -pe gpu 1 to login to the backend of ecdf
- qsub used to submit the bash file for running codes
- qstat for viewing the current status

NOTE:
the download procees should have already finished the step of setting tfrecord as well 
check the difference of the two codes and try

4.25=====================================================

12 format error
9 url error
